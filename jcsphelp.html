<h2>Usability and Accessibility</h2>

<!--Discuss reason for usability and accessibility page-->
<p>The Internet is used worldwide, and with that, I want each user no matter what condition to be
   able to have friendly access and be user friendly for all. For that reason, this page has been created
   to show what I have added to my website for all to use.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<!--Why images were utilized-->
<p>The images used on this website all have alternative texts if the browser being used cannot support 
   the images, if the images aren't loading properly, and if the user is visually impaired. Each of the images 
   on this website has an alternative name. The images offer a way for illiterate users to see what is being shown
   and discussed.</p>
 <!--List for alternative names-->
	<h4><i>Alternative Names Used</i></h4>
	<ul>
	   <li><b>The Centenarian</b></li>
	   <li><b>Connections: The Tony Marcello Story</b></li>
	   <li><b>Connections Part II: Final Affairs</b></li>
       <li><b>Email</b></li>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<!--How navigation in the website helps users-->
<p>Each page of this website has a means of navigation for other website links and for other uses on
   this website. The top navigation tool bar was included to allow the user better accessibility to content
   and to not have each page combined into one. Each link is colored blue before being clicked on, 
   red after the site has previously been visited, and yellow when being hovered over for potential
   users that are color blind. On the Contact page, "Click Here" was added for the user to go directly to ones 
   email and have my email already placed the "To:" section when clicked upon. When "Fields Report" is
   clicked, the user is automatically taken to a PDF of my fields report. Having it as a PDF in the navigation
   tool bar minimizes search and scrolling. When any link or navigation tab is clicked, the link clicked does not open a new page so the "Go Back"
   button can be utilized.</p>

<h3>Design and Structure</h3>

<!--How the design and structure of the website helps the user-->
<p>This website has been designed and structured to be easy to use for all people. The colors used 
   are to help those with varieties of color blindness. The text size is set in 17pt font for normal usability. If visually impaired,
   users can control the text size using the "Zoom In and Out" feature in the menu tool bar at the top of each browser.
   The screen size can be varied if side by side windows are opened. The further the screen is stretched, the less 
   scrolling will take place to view the site. The structure of the the site was designed to have flow
   to have better user experience.

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<!--Where the website is compatible--> 
<p>This site is compatible with PC's, tablets, smart phones, and consoles. The site is up to date with each
   browser allowing all functions to work correctly. This site uses CSS for layout which will only
   style the sheet if the browser being used is updated enough to support it. If the browser cannot, the site will have no style 
   but will still be available to see.</p> 

<h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<!--Keyboard Shortcuts with list-->
<p>Both Windows and Mac have keyboard shortcuts. These are two links a user can visit for help using the
   keyboard shortcuts.</p>
